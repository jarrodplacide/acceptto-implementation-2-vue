# Implementation-2

## Project Details
Create a VueJS component that allows the user to add/remove a list of email addresses. Use this component in another VueJS page and show all email addresses in comma separated format on the same page. For example if the user has added “x@domain.com” and “y@domain.com” the rendered CSV output will be “x@domain.com, y@domain.com”.
A simple UI is enough and no extra work is needed to be done on the UI part. However, using Docker Compose is an extra point.
